This tutorial will cover the creation of the example application found here:






Directory Structure
--------------------

To start with lets create the directory structure for this project. First create a directory called "note_example" and then create the folloing directory structure in it.

* assets
* build
* libs
* settings
* src
 * note
   * client
     * command
     * platform
         * note
             * view
   * model
     * domain
     * service
   * server
     * controller


We will be putting files in each of these directories and going over exactly what they mean but for now just create them.
